BB_ISP
======

Breadboard ISP adapter for 8 pin DIP ATtiny. This goes directly on top of the device on a breadboard and allows easy in circuit programming.
Should be compatible to: ATtiny 13, ATtiny 22 (90s2343),ATtiny 25, ATtiny 45 and ATtiny 85.

Inspired by [this](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1465).

Update: Boards arrived from OSH Park. See below for photos of the prototype.
